        <p><h4> The potato was cultivated in space for the first time in October 1995.
            The technique was developed by NASA and the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
            with the intention of feeding astronauts on lengthy space missions and,
            eventually, future space colonies. 
                In 1995, potato plants were taken into space with the space shuttle Columbia. 
                This marked the first time any food was ever grown in space. 
                The worlds largest potato weighed in at 18 pounds,
             4 ounces according to the Guinness Book of World Records.</h4></p>
